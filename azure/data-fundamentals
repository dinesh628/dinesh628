Relational Data: Rows in tables
- Traditional
- Hybrid: on-prem & cloud
- Prescribed columns/schema
- Query with SQL
- Familiar business reporting
Azure Relational Data Resources:
- SQL server on Azure VM
- Azure SQL DB
- Azure DB for open source : MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL
- Azure Synapse Analytics

Structured data: 
- Rigid schema(defined ahead of time or schema on write)
- same data for every entity 

Non Relation Data:
- NoSQL
- Generally cloud-native
- Semi-Structured
- Schema on read
- unstructred
- Query with SQL and more
- Sometimes "Scary to biz"

Non-Relational Data Resources:
- Cosmos DB - JSON documents
    - SQL API & MongoDB API
    - Gremlin Graph DB API
    - Cassandra API
- Azure Table Storage and API for it in Cosmos DB
- Azure Blob Storage

Semistructured and unstructured:
- Flexible or no schema.
- Data varies for each entity


Storing Data: Forms and Formats:
- Structured(rows and columns), Semi-Structured(documents, key-value,other), Unstructured(Blobs)
- JSON, XML, YAML
    - Semi-Structured
    - Human-readable text
    - Document databases: Cosmos DB
    - Blob storage
- Key-value and Wide-Column
    - Semi-strctured
    - Rows with schema-on-read
    - Key-value: Azure Table Storage
    - Wide-Column: Cassandra

    - No schema
    - May have metadata (eg:tags)


Managing Data: Moving, Processing, Securing
- Provision, Deploy, Secure
    - Define and set up infra
    - Put data assets on infra
    - set and enforce access
- Processing the data: batch or stream processing
    - Gather up data or process real-time in pipelines
    - etl 0R elt
    - Batch & Streaming
    - Batch:
        - Data collected in a group
        - Processing when cheap/convenient
        - Extract-Transform-load(ETL)
        - Dirty data can impact job success
        - Good for deep analysis vs real time
    - Streaming:
        - Real time or "micro-batch" processing
        - Latency measured in milliseconds
        - Event-driven ELT instead of ETL
        - Tolerant of non-confirming data
        - Typical access only to recent data
- Pipeline: orchestrator for data processing
- Big Data: 3 V's: Velocity=speed at which data arrives, Volume=big and Variety=diff kinds of data
- Transform Data
    - Manipulate raw data to conform to destination schema or use

- Analytical Workloads
    - OLAP: Real-Time (Online Analytical Processing)
    - Larger, richer data sets optimized for decision support and complex questions posed of the data
- Industry data
    - Master Data
    - Industry or domain specific data sets that change infrequently.
- HTAP: Hybrid transactional analytic processing
    - Refers to aspects of supporting both transactionl and analytical workloads over the same set of data.

Azure SQL, NoSQL, MySQL, YourSQL
- Row, Partition and primary keys
- Schema-on-read and schema-on-write
- Azure Storage (debatable)
- Most Azure Data Resources are Paas
    - Exceptions:
        - SQL server or other on a VM
        - Azure Storage (debatable)
- Four Primary Types of Azure DB Resources
    - Azure SQL DB Family
    - Cosmos DB
    - Azure Storage: Blobs and Tables
- Open Source Relational:
    - PostgresSQL
    - MySQL
    - MariaDB
- OLTP: Online Transactional Processing (Transactional workloads)
    - Operational data i.e. processed in short, precise, isolated actions. Optimized for speed and accuracy within the interaction.
    - Strong Consistency: 
        - How well or how quickly data is kept in sync with itself and with replicas if itself.
        - When synching is enforced strictly then we called it as consistency.
        - Strong consistency is required for ensuring transactional integrity.
- OLAP: Online Analytical Processing (analytics workloads)
    - Larger, richer datasets optimized for decision support and complex questions posed of the data.
    - Eventual Consistency:
        - It is impt that all related data stores & replicas be in sync, eventually.
        - but the timing around capaturing the data is much more impt and outweighs the need to wait around for all systems to catch up even waiting is measured in milliseconds.
        - eg: Predict risk of weather events or equipment failure.
- Hybrid Scenarios:
    - Many scenarios represent some combinations of both workload types

Data Resource Management: Four alternative rules 
- Securing Data
    - The Azure SQL data by default blocks the connectivity to the world.
    - Azure Cosmos DB and Azure storage the default is to enable broad access to everyone & everything.
    - Connectivity to on-prem, vNet etc.
    - Firewalls
    - Connectivity from Private Endpoints
    - Authentication: access keys
    - Access Control, RBAC - IAM (Identity access management)
    - Advanced Data security
    - Encryption: TLS/TDE
    - Fine-Grained control: Dynamic Data Masking, Row-Level security.

- Relational Data
    - Normalized Relational Data
        - Data is consistently formatted
        - Normalized data is data that has been deliberately split up
            into multiple tables in order to improve performance for write 
            operations or to better ensure data consistency.
        - Indexes in Relational Data
            - Heap, Clustered Index
            - The clustered indexes includes all of the columns of the original table.
            -  Non-clustered indexes depends on clustered indexes to return column values in the data
                because they typically store only the column or columns on which they're ordered.
            - Covering index- a special kind of non-clustered index called a covering index.
                other columns that you might commonly want to return. This prevents a round
                trip to the clustered index, but it also increases the size of your non-clustered 
                index, so its a trade off.
